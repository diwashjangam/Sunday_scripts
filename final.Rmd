Final project of the Workshop in which I had to filter out the population of Nepal, Spain and Iran and plot them on a figure. This is awesome **:) :) :)**

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
gap.in %>%
filter(country=="Spain") -> Spain
plot(Spain$year,Spain$pop, main="population change over time of Spain", col="red", xlab="year", ylab="population")

gap.in %>%
filter(country=="Nepal") -> Nepal
plot(Nepal$year,Nepal$pop, main="population change over time of Nepal", col="blue", xlab="year", ylab="population")

gap.in %>%
filter(country=="Iran") -> Iran
plot(Iran$year,Iran$pop, main="population change over time of Iran", col="green", xlab="year", ylab="population")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
